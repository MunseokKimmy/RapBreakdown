        <p> 1. Note Illmac's deliberate use of internal rhymes, rhyming 'use it to train' with 'fuel for the flame' and 'review the tapes' and 'do what I say'. </p>

          <p> 3. Before this battle, Bigg K was considered a high-potential up-and-coming battler. Illmaculate was already a legend from the GrindTime Era of battling, thus him taking this battle against a younger battler was definitely a token of respect given to Bigg K. Although this round was a tragic cut to Bigg K's streak of wins. </p>

    <p>
      This <em>troop is in training, salute </em><br>
  It <strong>ain't</strong> the <em>music, the fame or the views</em><br>
  Don't <strong>blame</strong> the <em>rules of the game, you'll lose</em><br>
  <strong>Use it to train,</strong> that's <em>fuel for the flame that grew</em><br>
  <strong>Review the tapes,</strong> <em>do what I say to do</em><br>
  And watch the <em>moves that you make improve</em><br>
  See, K, I could step my <strong>game(1)</strong> up while still <em>doin' the same for you!</em><br>
  Salute when you see me, tell 'em to let them <em>horns blow</em><br>
  This is my <strong>second coming, my forthcoming(2)</strong> was <em>foretold</em><br>
  This is his <em>corpse cold</em> on the floor, blood on the wall<br>
  Swingin' a <em>sword slow</em> through the <em>torso</em> of his <em>torn soul</em><br>
  My hands reach <em>out from the abyss</em><br>
  Remove the <em>ground under his kicks</em><br>
  His soul lifts from the <em>ground up and it drifts</em><br>
  Into <em>cloud, cover and mist</em>, he <em>shouts clutchin' a fist</em><br>
  But feels his <em>mouth's covered in stitch</em><br>
  He's <em>now stuck in a glitch</em> where <em>sound doesn't exist</em><br>
  He could <em>see though</em> that he's <em>marked for death</em><br>
  That revelation made him <em>reload</em>, even though our <em>bars reflect</em><br>
  The scene with <em>Neo</em> and the <em>Architect</em><br>
  <em>We are</em> connected like <em>DARPANet</em><br>
  I'll fly a <em>charter jet</em> into your thought bubble<br>
  And <em>park direct</em>ly in front of the verse you 'bout to <em>start with next</em><br>
  This is plastic <em>army men</em> to nuclear <em>armament</em><br>
  Every <em>dollar spent</em> <em>on defense</em> in the <em>HAARP project</em><br>
  Each bar: an <em>armored mech</em>, <em>alarm detection</em><br>
  <em>Armed and set</em> to <em>target threats</em><br>
  Each word: a <em>sharpened edge</em>, <em>scar his flesh</em><br>
  Carve it through his <em>heart's contents</em> 'til my <em>heart's content</em><br>
  <em>Rewind it first</em>, instead of threatenin'<br>
  You're goin' to <em>die in verses</em>, <em>I reverse it</em><br>
  They're payin' me not to kill you... let your <em>mind interpret</em><br>
  Soon as that contract was <em>signed in cursive</em><br>
  Your <em>life was purchased!</em><br>
  <em>Rewind it furth</em>er, before you lost this <em>battle to a vet</em><br>
  Before you seen Org<em>anik in the flesh</em><br>
  Yelling <em>"Rapper to my left!"</em><br>
  I accepted this <strong>match-up(3)</strong> as a <em>matter of respect</em><br>
  So you should feel honored when I de<em>capitate your neck</em><br>
  Blood <em>splashin' on the steps</em><br>
  In the <em>cracks of the cement</em> until the <em>avenue is wet</em><br>
  But wait! That's when you <strong>snap</strong> out of it<br>
  Wake up <em>drownin' in a sweat</em><br>
  <em>Grabbin' at your chest</em>, <em>gaspin' for a breath</em><br>
  You look around you, but instead of a <em>casket it's your bed</em><br>
  And you realize we <strong>haven't</strong> <strong>battled(4)</strong> yet<br>
  This all <em>happened in your head</em><br>
  Just <strong>imagine</strong> what's gonna <strong>happen(5)</strong> at the <em>actual event!</em></p>

          <p> 2. Illmac uses wordplay with comparing 'Second Coming' and 'Forth (fourth) Coming.' Who knows when his Third Coming is?</p>

            <p> 4. Did Bigg K really dream all of those terribly dramatic things? Did he really wake up and realize the battle hadn't yet occurred? Who knows, it's battle rap. </p>

              <p> 5. This concept round from Illmaculate was immaculate. Not only was it a completely unique and revolutionary round, full of imagery and braggadocious dominance-assertion, it left Bigg K's next round falling flat. No one was ready to go back to death threats and gun bars after hearing such a poetic projection like this round.</p>
